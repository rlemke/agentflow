"""AFL step state machine definitions.

This module defines the states and transitions for step execution.
There are three state machines:
- StepStateChanger: Full state machine for VariableAssignment
- BlockStateChanger: Simplified for AndThen blocks
- YieldStateChanger: Minimal for YieldAssignment
